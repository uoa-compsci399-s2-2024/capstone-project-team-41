Project 18 - RemindMate

This project involves creating a mobile application designed to help users maintain and strengthen their social connections. The app will offer the
following key functionalities:
Add Friends: Users can easily add their friends' names and contact information, whether they are local or abroad.
Customisable Reminders: Users can set personalized reminders at chosen intervals to prompt them to reach out and send messages to their
friends, ensuring regular communication. No message sending within the app though.
Friendship Notes: Users can store detailed information about each friend, including birthdays, important dates, and notes on past
conversations, serving as a comprehensive "friendship journal."
Notifications: The app sends timely notifications based on the set reminders, helping users never miss an opportunity to connect with their
friends.
User-Friendly Interface: The app should feature an intuitive design, allowing users to effortlessly navigate, add friends, set reminders, and
manage notes.
